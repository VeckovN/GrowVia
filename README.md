## Project Overview

This project consists of two main parts:

- **E-commerce Marketplace (Core Functionality) **
- **IoT Sensor Features for Farmers (Subscription-based SaaS layer )**

### E-commerce Marketplace (Main Part)
- **Backend**: Implemented
- **Frontend**: Currently in development

**Growvia** is a microservice-based, event-driven, multi-vendor e-commerce platform designed to connect local farmers with consumers.  
The platform supports several user roles including **farmers**, **customers**, **guests**, and a potential **admin panel** (currently under consideration).

Farmers can register, manage their profiles, create and manage product listings, confirm and update orders, and have invoices generated automatically.

While the primary focus is the marketplace, Growvia is built with extensibility in mind, serving as a foundation for future real-time features, personalized experiences, and analytics.

### IoT Features (Second Part)

Farmers will be able to subscribe to IoT-based features, gaining access to real-time and historical sensor data such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Soil moisture
- pH levels
.etc

The platform will offer data-driven insights including predictions, alerts, and recommendations based on historical sensor trends.

### Consumer Experience

Customers can:

- Create personal profiles
- Browse products with advanced filtering options
- Add items to their cart
- Place orders via **Stripe**
- Track order statuses (real-time delivery tracking under consideration)

Guests may explore the marketplace but must register to complete purchases.
